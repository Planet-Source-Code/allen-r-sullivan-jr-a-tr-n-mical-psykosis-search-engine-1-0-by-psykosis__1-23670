### Description

-v-(updated)-v- I have added a few other needed files that a few submissions have asked for, I will probably put out a better version without any bugs as soon as it is fully tested. Thank you for your input for those that have checked out my code and thank you for voting. For those that have seen the code, it is quite unique, eh?                        This code will search through your computer for the specified files you type, and will list any files (with paths) as they appear. If coded properly you can use this code to make some type of shell program for later use, or....well....use your imagination. Since i have not seen this posted yet, nor have i ever seen anyone actually do it, i decided to make this my first post.

If you like it, use it, But please give me credit by putting me in your greets or something. Or if you make a program i would love to see how this code enhanced it in any way. Thank you
 
### More Info
